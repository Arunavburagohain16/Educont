The Entrepreneurship – Innovation Cell in collaboration with the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India is under consideration while the Industry – Institute Partnership Cell (IIPC) has already been established to promote the industry linkages. Linkages with other technical institutes of the region are also being initiated by conducting pool campuses for placement of the students, various technical events like Robotics Competition, Business Plan and Technical Paper writing competitions etc. The Society is currently promoting social engineering projects as part of its linkage with the local community and the government. Various projects with social impact are being implemented and prepared for implementation such as:

Conversion of the community crematorium at Azara, Guwahati into an Electrical crematorium utilising electrical design inputs from the Department of Electrical Engineering, GIMT – Guwahati. 

Wildlife tracking and monitoring of elephant routes in and around the Deepor Beel areas to prevent death of the elephants by the trains utilising GPS system and other communication devices.

Development of semi power looms for augmenting the local handloom industry.

Pilot Project for solution towards control of artificial floods in Guwahati.



The SSA Society by means of the above mentioned project proposals would like to shoulder some additional responsibility in areas which can contribute towards the emancipation of the Assamese society in particular and the entire north eastern region in general. These projects are being proposed with the sole aim of contributing towards a better quality of life to the common people.

The Pilot Project for solution towards control of artificial floods in Guwahati is directed towards the drainage congestion and flooding problems of Guwahati. This problem is being observed closely by a group of people comprising of some faculty members, student groups and members of the management for several years. It is obvious that the problem is complex and no single measure on its own is adequate for providing reasonable relief to the people of Guwahati. Besides the problem needs to be tackled by both structural as well as non structural measures. Comprehensive long term planning of such a complex and dynamic problem requires careful study and dependable data. Therefore it is high time that the concerned authorities constitute a core study group with a mandate to carry out the required survey and investigation, collect all the required data and prepare a fresh and comprehensive master plan keeping future requirement in view. The SSA Society is interested to get involved as a voluntary organisation in such a scientific study and contribute to the process in pursuance of the past works that the Society has already carried out as part of this pilot project.

 

 

 

The Society though its engineering and pharmacy institutes have worked with various government initiatives for promotion of technology and to resolve regional imbalance with the rest of the country. 

Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Management and Technology – Guwahati (GIMT) hosted the Smart India Hackathon 2017. The event was conducted by All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi and was an initiative of the mygov.in of the Government of India. GIMT- Guwahati was one of the 23 nodal centres all over India to host Smart India Hackathon.

It is to be noted that GIMT-Guwahati was the only nodal centre in the Northeast for the Hackathon ’17.  The grand finale witnessed simultaneous brainstorming competitions across 26 nodal centres in India during the two-day-long event. The Smart India Hackathon 2017 was the first massive scale hackathon initiative in India unprecedented in the nation’s history

For the first time ever, 29 different government ministries and departments came together and posed 598 problem statements to 30 lakh technical students from India During Smart India Hackathon 2017, for the first time ever 10000+ technical students worked for 36 hours nonstop to build tools that the nation will benefit from. The digital solutions that were created will improve the functioning and governance of different government departments. There has probably never been a better example of using our demographic dividend for building our nation. 

Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Pharmaceutical Science – Guwahati (GIPS) is a founder member of the North East Pharmaceutical Society which is a voluntary organization established in the year 2017 to encompass entire North Eastern states of India, thereby catering its services towards developing Pharmacy professionalism and also to create an environment for scientific research in Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology. The society is working with a vision to be the most trusted professional group by ensuring quality human resources and its appropriate utilization, to protect the welfare of the public through the provision of excellence in pharmaceutical services at all times. The mission is to promote, strengthen and expand the Pharmaceutical sciences through administration, education & research, motivation and communication in the North East India. GIPS under the aegis of this Society also hosted the North East Pharmaceutical Convention (NEPC) which was a sincere initiative of Pharmacists from all sectors related to Industry, regulatory, academia, hospital pharmacy and other related fields.  North East India due to its topographical location and connectivity with South Asian Nations has a potential to be a major Pharmaceutical Hub of the country and can have significant contributions to the country export. NEPC was an effort to expose the potential of this region to get transformed into a Pharmaceutical Hub in the country under the Act East Policy launched in Nov 2014 and Make in India policy of the Government of India and thereby a parade for the North East Industrial Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP) to rejuvenate. This will further be helpful in creating awareness and more job opportunities for the thousands of aspiring Pharmacy professionals (e.g. D. Pharm, B. Pharm, M. Pharm, Pharm.D, PhD.) of the region.  The NEPC was also an attempt to evolve collective wisdom of Pharmacy Professionals of the region for formulating newer policies in the relevant fields and for the betterment of the profession and health care system. The rich biodiversity and traditional medicinal practices are still mostly untapped and has huge potential. There is a need to explore the rich heritage of medicinal plants in this area and should attract more Pharmaceutical research in this field. In this convention, Plenary talks, Scientific Sessions, Oral and Poster Presentations of Pharmaceutical Researches, Pharma Expo and Job fair in the presence of eminent personalities from Regulatory, Industry and Academia were organized.  

GIPS also organized “METASIS” a one day workshop on medical, aromatic plants and spices (MAPS) with the theme techno commercial feasibility of selected high value MAPs and Spices with special reference to the North East India. The main objectives of this workshop was to:

Foster social upliftment and livelihood promotional activities in the region.

Promote agri – preneurship and sustainable interventions.

Bring all the key players in the value chain from “producer to end user”and remove the critical gaps.

Promote the commercialization of aromatic and medical plants from the north eastern region.

This workshop was attended by various scientists, research scholars, nongovernmental organizations and progressive farmers of the region.

The Shrimanta Shankar Academy Senior Secondary School, Dispur has been selected for the establishment of the Atal Tinkering lab by the Niti Ayog, New Delhi. The main aim of this lab is to ‘Cultivate one Million children in India as Neoteric Innovators’, and is one of the visions of the Atal Innovation Mission i.e. establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) in schools across India. The objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds; and inculcate skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical computing etc. The school will be provided with a grant-in-aid that includes a one-time establishment cost of Rs. 10 lakh and operational expenses of Rs. 10 lakh for a maximum period of 5 years.

 

The Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Management and Technology – Guwahati under the aegis of the Shrimanta Shankar Academy Society has entered into a collaboration with the District Administration of Morigaon District, Government of Assam for development of a the Chanaka Village under Block Block, District Morigaon as a Model Village.According to the 2011 census, 68.9% of our population lives in the rural areas. Though this number is expected to decrease but till 2050, at least 50% of our population will still continue to live in rural areas. In spite of a plethora of development initiatives by the Central and State Government in the past and present there still exists a wide gap between these Schemes and actual development. The main reason for this gap as stated by the “Adarsh Gram” concept note of the present Government is the lack of a holistic focus on the village as a unit. Majority of the villages in the country still face constraints such as access to education, health facilities, drinking water, power, power, roads etc.Considering the above, the Shrimanta Shankar Academy Society in collaboration with HELP- Human Elephant Learning Programme, a non governmental organisation working towards the conservation of wildlife and their habitat has adopted the CHANAKA Village situated in the District of Morigaon to develop the village into a Model Village by ensuring a holistic and integrated development of the same.
